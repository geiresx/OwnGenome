"""owngenome_live_family.py: the family page of the live site (a bin/owngenome_live.py plugin).

A family folder under GENOME_DIR (one holding members.tsv or pedigree.tsv, as
steps 38 and 39 and the Nextflow family workflow leave it) is listed as a run
of kind "family". Its page shows the pedigree, drawn from that file at request
time by bin/pedigree_svg.py, each child's chromosome map
(<child>_segments.svg), the relationship check, the shared segments and the
couple carrier screen, as the steps wrote them. A sample's page links to the
family it is in.

  GET /family/<family>/<file>   pedigree.svg (drawn), or one of the family's
                                result files listed in state.json; any other
                                name is 404
  GET /runs/<family>/family.json  the family page's data (assets/live/family.html):
                                the state below, the pedigree's layout (so each
                                person is a link), the relationship and shared-
                                segment rows with their measured numbers, each
                                couple's gene rows, each child's inherited
                                stretches (<child>_segments.tsv), the de novo and
                                compound-het candidates (de_novo.tsv,
                                compound_het.tsv) with whether each child was
                                assessed and why not (trio_status; a file linking
                                out of the folder is "rejected" in trio_file_state),
                                each member's run progress and attention count,
                                and the members side by side: CYP2D6, the CPIC
                                genes, HLA, the haplogroups and every blood group
                                system, each value with its stale flag (from each
                                summary.json only)

state.json gets plugins.family: {"kind": "family", ...} on a family's page,
{"kind": "member", "families": [...]} on the page of a sample in a family,
{"kind": "member", "families": [], "unknown": true} when no readable family
lists the sample but a family's pedigree could not be read, null otherwise.

The plugin computes nothing about genetics: it reads the files the steps
wrote, counts their rows and draws the pedigree the file declares.
